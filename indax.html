            <p class="sectionTag text-big"> Definitions of education</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> aim to describe the essential features of
                education. A great variety of definitions has been proposed. There is wide agreement that education
                involves, among other things, the transmission of knowledge. But there are deep disagreements about its
                exact nature and characteristics. Some definitions see education as a process exemplified in events like
                schooling, teaching, and learning. Others understand it not as a process but as the product of such
                processes, i.e. as what characterizes educated persons. Various attempts have been made to give precise
                definitions listing its necessary and sufficient conditions. The failure of such attempts, often in the
                form of being unable to account for various counterexamples, has led many theorists to adopt less
                precise conceptions based on family resemblance. On this view, different forms of education are similar
                by having overlapping features but there is no set of features shared by all forms. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> There are various ways how forms of education are commonly subdivided
                into different types. The most common subdivision is between formal, non-formal, and informal
                education.[33][34][6] However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and informal
                education.[35] A process of teaching constitutes formal education if it happens in a complex
                institutionalized framework. Such frameworks are usually chronologically and hierarchically organized as
                in modern schooling systems, which have different classes based on the student's age and progress, all
                the way from primary school to university. Because of its scale, formal education is usually controlled
                and guided by a governmental entity and is normally compulsory up to a certain age.[33][36] Non-formal
                and informal education differ from formal education due to their lack of such a governmental
                institutionalized framework. Non-formal education constitutes a middle ground in the sense that it is
                also organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear purpose in mind, such as tutoring, fitness
                classes, or the scouting movement.[33][36][6] Informal education, on the other hand, happens in </p>
